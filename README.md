🎵 Simon Game

A classic memory challenge built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.

📝 About the Project

The Simon Game is a fun memory-based game where players must repeat an increasingly long sequence of colors and sounds.
This project was created to practice JavaScript event handling, timing functions, arrays, and game logic while building an engaging UI.
